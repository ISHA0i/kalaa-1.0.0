# Fix for JSON Parse Error

The error was occurring because:
1. There was a case sensitivity mismatch in the server file naming
2. This could prevent the backend server from starting properly in some environments
3. When the backend server isn't running, the frontend's fetch requests fall back to the React dev server, which returns HTML instead of JSON

To fix this:
1. Updated the server file path comment to match the actual filename case (Server.js)
2. Ensure the backend server is running on port 3001 before starting the frontend
3. The frontend is already configured to use the correct URL (http://localhost:3001/api/products)

Steps to run the application:
1. Start the backend server first:
   ```bash
   cd BACKEND
   npm start
   ```
2. Start the frontend in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   cd FRONTEND
   npm start
   ```

The application should now work correctly with proper JSON responses from the backend API.
